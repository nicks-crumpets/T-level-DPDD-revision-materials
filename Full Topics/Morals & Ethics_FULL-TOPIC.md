    - What are some privacy concerns over big data? >>>
        - Data collection - Companies often collect much more data than needed, leading to privacy and surveillance concerns
        - Surveillance - Governments & companies can track people using big data, raising concerns about control & consent
        - Lack of control - Once collected, an individual often has little/no power on how their personal data is used
    - What was the Cambridge Analytical scandal of 2018?→In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, had improperly harvested data from 87 million Facebook users **without their consent**
    - What ways does data bias show ethics? >>>
        - Data reflects society - Big data reflects social biases and this is often shown in big data
        - Discrimination - AI systems may discriminate over people of a different race, ethnicity et
        - Ethical responsibility - Companies and governments should work to eliminate bias (But aren't incentivized to!)
    - What are 3 ethical guidelines for big data use? >>>
        - Transparency - Companies should be clear about data collection & how it is used
        - Accountability - There must be consequences for misuse/unethical practices
        - Consent - Users should have clear, accessible options to give & withdraw consent for data collection & use
    - What's the predicted future of big data ethics? >>>
        - Stronger regulation - Governments across the world are introducing stricter privacy laws (California CCPA, UK GDPR)
        - Consumer rights - Consumers are demanding more control of their data, pushing companies to rethink data practices (or just deny and deny and bury them further)
        - Balancing innovation and ethics - As data becomes the backbone of technological innovation, ethics need to adapt to keep use responsible

    - What are the main negatives of IoT? >>>
        - Security vulnerabilities - Often IoT has weak security protocols, making them susceptible to cyber hacks
        - Data privacy - Masses of personal data are collected causing concern over how organisations use it
        - Compatibility issues - Many devices and platforms cause issues working together
        - Reliability - IoT devices require constant internet connection (typically, good ones can run on local networks) and power supply (or battery backup) to function, masses would fail with server or power issues
