Revision materials for the T level in Digital Production Design and Development.
This is **not made for the T Level Digital Support Services**, however the ESP task is the same

This **only contains first year material currently** and will contain seccond year material later, because i'm currently only in the first year :)

Currently these are not finished, and contain only flashcards but will be updated as they're created

## Individual Topics - Reccomended
These folders are just named as their topics and contain separate files for each of the sections/points within  a topic, allowing you to practice a specfifc section within a topic

## Full Topics
This folder will have every topic as a single file containing all of the cards for the topic

##

For anyone who's interested, all the flashcards were made with remnote and exported as markdown files so they can be conpatible with as many fashcard apps as possible. If you're looking for a different format for the cards let me know
