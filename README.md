# T-level-DPDD-revision-materials


Revision materials for the **T level in Digital Production Design and Development**
This is **not made for the T Level Digital Support Services**, however the ESP task, and topics such as digital environments remain the same. Please check first what ones apply to you if you're on this course, don't revise the wrong stuff! (See bottom of page for links to the revision material for that course)

### ONLY FIRST YEAR MATERIAL CURRENTLY
I'm only in my first year of this course, after I have completed the second year the notes for
that will go here too.

# Topic notes

These are longer form notes made over various lessons, made originally in Notion, they'll be
in a format that can be put back into Notion or a similar editor, and available as an HTML page

To navigate, these are layed out with the topics as markdown files with links to individual sub-topics as links inside the file.
In V0.1 the links are broken due to naming constraints, however you can browse the folders for the sub-topics.


# Flashcards
Cards that I made to help with the basic retention of the stuff you'll need to know for 1 - 3 markers and general knowledge to use in longer quetions. See below for the types :)

## Individual Topics - *Recommended*
These folders are just named as their topics and contain separate files for each of the sections/points
within  a topic, allowing you to practice a specific section within a topic

## Full Topics
This folder will have every topic as a single file containing all the cards for the topic

#

For anyone who's interested, all the flashcards were made with RemNote and exported as markdown files
so they can be compatible with as many flashcard apps as possible. If you're looking for a different
format for the cards let me know
