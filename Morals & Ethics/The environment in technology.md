- What are 3 positive impacts of technology for the environment? >>>
    - Renewable energy technology (solar, hydro, geothermic etc.)
    - Environmental monitoring/data collection (Satellite monitoring)
    - Waste management & recycling (Waste to energy, recycling)
    - Remote working (less transport and heating offices)
- What are 3 negative impacts of technology for the environment? >>>
    - Increased power consumption (4% Greenhouse gas emissions are IT, data centres use 70B kWh annually)
    - Resources used (1 phone = 12,760L water and relies on rare earth metals, can cause environmental destruction)
    - E-Waste (In 2022 57.4Mil. metric tones of e-waste were produced globally)
- What are the impacts of E-Waste on the environment? >>>
    - Can release harmful harmful substances into the environment (toxic metals such as lead & mercury)
    - WEE is how they are supposed to be recycled
    - Only 17.4% of e-waste is recycled globally
- What is planned obsolescence?→A strategy where there is a planned limited lifespan of a product that happens before the hardware is beyond a reasonably useable state
- What is technological obsolescence?→Where a company makes a new model with improved features to make the older models look more outdated than they actually are
- What is programmed obsolescence?→Where products are designed to stop working or have a reduced functionality after a certain time, before the hardware goes beyond a useable state
- What is perceived obsolescence?→Marketing to create a want for new models of a product. Common in the fashion industry
- What is systemic obsolescence?→Updates to software or systems, making older hardware incompatible, often before the expected hardware lifecycle
