- How does IoT work? >>1.
    1. Sensors - Motion detectors, cameras etc collect data from the environment
    2. Connectivity - IoT devices connect via wireless technologies to send data to cloud platforms or other device(s)
    3. Cloud & Data processing - Data collected is commonly processed in the cloud, or locally, with data analysis carried out to interpret and act on the data.
    4. UI (User Interface) - Apps, touchscreens, buttons and voice assistants allow users to control & interact with IoT devices/systems
- What is the global IoT market worth (2024)?→The global IoT market is worth ~ $1Bn USD
- What are some key applications of IoT? >>>
    - Smart homes - Doorbells, fridges, ovens, washing machines etc
    - Healthcare - Wearables, remote monitoring etc
    - IIoT (Industrial IoT) - Used in factories for predictive maintenance to increase efficiency
    - ‘Smart’ cities - Used to manage traffic, reduce energy usage, enhance pubic safety etc
- What are the main benefits of IoT? >>>
    - Reduced costs - Automating processes and using real time monitoring cuts down on labour and therefore employee count
    - Improved safety - Monitoring workplace environments to identify hazards before accidents happen
    - Reduction in human error - Tasks that needed manual input are automated leaving little to no chance for human error
    - Data collection - Collects & shares data through embedded sensors, provides organisations vast amounts of information for analysis
- What are the main negatives of IoT? >>>
    - Security vulnerabilities - Often IoT has weak security protocols, making them susceptible to cyber hacks
    - Data privacy - Masses of personal data are collected causing concern over how organisations use it
    - Compatibility issues - Many devices and platforms cause issues working together
    - Reliability - IoT devices require constant internet connection (typically, good ones can run on local networks) and power supply (or battery backup) to function, masses would fail with server or power issues
