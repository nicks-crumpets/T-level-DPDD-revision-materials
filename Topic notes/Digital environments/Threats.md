# Threats

# Botnets

A network of computers *“Bots”* controlled by a single attacker to control machines in a network. Bots are infected with malware that puts them in the attackers control.

An infected bot is known as a *zombie*

The attacker can command the bots to do anything they want, typically to carry out an attack. The attacker will send updates remotely to manipulate what the infected machines do.

On a large scale (millions) botnets can cause massive damage, with large ones having portions being rented on the black market!

A botnet is just a network of computers, so not illegal!
It just depends what you’re doing with it

Can infect most devices connected to the internet, with basically any unsecured device

IoT devices are particularly the most vulnerable to these attacks, due to a lack of security.

## Examples

**The 2018 GitHub Attack** – February 2018, a large botnet carried out the largest DDoS attack ever recorded. Generating peak incoming traffic of an unprecedented 1.35Tbps, the attack took *GitHub*, the largest software development platform on the internet, offline for a few minutes.

**The 2016 Mirai Attack** – Named after a popular anime series, Mirai was a botnet consisting of more than 100,000 computers. It made the news in 2016, when it launched attacks against several cyber security companies, generating traffic volumes of 1Tbps and taking down a large part of their online infrastructure.

**The 2014 Hong Kong Attack** – The 2014 political unrest in Hong Kong provoked the *then-largest* DDoS attack in history when at least a few large botnets joined forces against pro-democracy websites in the country. Many have accused the Chinese government of this attack, but the actual perpetrator remains unknown.

# Eavesdropping attacks

Theft of information being transmitted over a network by a device.

The attack takes advantage of unsecured network communication data, and are usually designed to get business or financial information.

This can either usually be in the form of a fake or spoofed network connection, or software on a network or device  (packet sniffers)

This can be prevented by using a firewall, up to date antivirus, and a VPN, as well as a strong password.

Public WiFi networks are often insecure and therefore obviously shouldn’t be used for sensitive transactions.

# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

DDoS attacks are being increasingly used as a competitive business tool, with some assaults being used to prevent a competitor from participating in a significant event (e.g black Friday). 

This has the goal of shutting down online businesses for months.+

# Hacking (Good ol’ reliable)

Activities designed to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones etc.

Might not always be for malicious purposes, can be for ethical purposes.

Can steal purposeful information such as names, addresses, and personal info.

## **White hat**

- **Hack to find and fix vulnerabilities in a system**
- **White hat** hackers are typically seen as hackers who use their skills to **benefit society**

- They may be reformed black hat hackers, or they may simply be well-versed in the methods and techniques used by hackers

## **Grey hat**

- The **grey hat** generally has the skills and intent of the white hat but will **break into any system or network without permission**.

- When they discover a vulnerability, instead of telling the vendor how the exploit works, they may offer to repair it for a small fee.

## **Black hat**

- **Black Hat** hackers are **criminals** who break into computer networks with **malicious intent**.
- They may also **release malware** that destroys files, holds computers hostage.

- They may **steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information**.

# Ransomware

Where someone encrypts data and requests money or other forms of payment to decrypt it.

The best way to combat against this is backups (and education/training)

## Types of ransomware

1. Encrypts - Encrypts files and data, then you have to buy the decryption key to get the files back. Often these payments are also scams and the files are never encrypted, or the attackers leave themselves a backdoor to easily carry out the attack again
2. Lockers - Lock applications and/or your system, with a screen showing their demands, sometimes with things like a ‘countdown until deletion’
3. Scareware - Fake software that claims you have had a virus, or been caught doing something that never happened. Often flooding the computer with pop-ups and/or locking the computer
4. Doxware - Hack that threatens to leak personal or company information. Preys on people paying to avoid the data getting to the wrong people

# Malware

A catch-all term for any type of malicious software designed to harm and/or exploit any programmable device (ROM-only devices are usually immune [not PROM or EPROM])

This is used to extract money, messages, or other types of information (usually it’s money in the end)

It is used to extract data to contact other victims to attack too!

## What are the signs of malware?

The most common signs a device has malware are…

- Lower than normal performance
- Unexpected browser redirects
- Frequent pop-ups with an incentive to pay money
- Issues shutting down & starting up a device
- Frequent pop-up advertisements

Any of these symptoms should be a huge warning sign of likely malware, and you should get an antivirus and complete a scan. 

The strongest indicators are browser redirects and frequent pop-up advertisements (however if this is just when going to a single page, likely the page has been compromised

No matter what’s happened, if you have a symptom of malware, or something feels off, **run an antivirus scan**

## What are the best ways to stay protected?

1. Keep operating systems and applications updated. All types of hackers are looking for vulnerabilities in old or outdated software 
2. Never click any links in a popup, or email, or message from someone you don’t personally know (even be wary of links from people you know, their account could have been compromised)
3. Limit the applications on your devices & make sure that you are downloading applications from the developer and a reliable source
4. Use a mobile security application such as Malware Bytes (McAfee is overpriced and has far too many pop-ups)

# Social engineering

Phishing - Tricking someone into giving away sensitive information, or directly giving away money, or making someone click a link or a button that may install something, or lead to pharming through a link

Pharming - Redirecting a user to a faker copy of a legitimate website 

Spear phishing - Targeting a specific person or group (usually using personalized bait)

Whaling - Targeting a person of power in a group or organisation (such as a CEO, or Admin)

Smishing - Phishing over the use of SMS (Should RCShing be a thing then? or iMesshing?)

Email Phishing - Phishing… over email!

Vishing - Phishing over voice calls
