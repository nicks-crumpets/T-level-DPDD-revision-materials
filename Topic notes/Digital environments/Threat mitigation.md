# Threat mitigation

# Air gapping

An air gapped network is one that’s physically isolated and isn’t connected to any other network. The only way any data can get onto an air-gapped network is by physically inserting a removable device (e.g. USB Stick, External SSD)

Antivirus/anti-malware

API Certification

Configuration & management of software based access control

# Hot and cold backup sites

## Hot/warm backup sites

Places that are entirely set up for business in case something happens to a companies office and are ready to go on the latest backups, with machines set up and ready to use in minutes

## Cold backup sites

Places with all of the infrastructure to work but no actual data and sometimes no clients and servers, so these would need to be bought after moving in if a disaster occurred. Usually used as a third or fourth backup or when a hot backup site is too expensive considering the risk of disaster

# Device hardening

A collection of tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce vulnerability in technology applications, systems etc

It aims to reduce risk by eliminating weak points and lowing the attack surface

# Symmetric encryption

Encryption to make a man in the middle attack unintelligible 

Also known as shared key or shared secret encryption

Common examples are: DES, 3DES, AES, RC4

# Asymmetric encryption

More computing power is needed to decrypt and encrypt the cipher

Also known as public-key cryptography

The most common asymmetric encryption algorithm is RSA

# Hashing

Hashing condenses a message into a fixed length irreversible hash, for example MD5 and SHA-1

# User access restrictions/Permissions

Usernames, passphrases, passwords

Data access levels

Physical access control

# Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

Authentication through password and another mean:

- Possession based - By normally a phone that has a code that changes every X seconds
- Biometrics - Fingerprint, FaceID etc
- Knowledge Based - Secret question
- Location based access control - Must be at SausageHQ
- 

# Firewalls & Proxy

Network device that **monitors packets** going in and out of networks and **blocks or allows them according to rules that have been set up**   

**Proxy based firewalls** act as a gateway between end users who request data and the source of that data

# **VPN**

A **virtual private network**, or **VPN**, is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network

# Human threats

- Malicious employees
- Disguised criminals
