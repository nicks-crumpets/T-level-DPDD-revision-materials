# Types of network model

- **Client server** - Multiple devices can be interconnected and share information. As business expands and people work together remotely, this allows them to reach a common shared database, program and resources such as email, web and printers

Advantages

- Shared resources accessed and updated from anywhere
- More control over what is saved
- More secure as storage is centralised

Disadvantages

- Risk of system overload
- Not having enough resources for all clients
- If there’s no  network then people can’t reach their data

# Thin client

*A low power computer that runs using a centralised servers resources, as opposed to a local storage drive.*

Thin clients connect to a server based computing environment where applications, data and memory are stored.

Other names for these are dumb terminals or zero cliENT
