# Cloud environments

Cloud has had continued mass adoption, used as key elements of IoT, remote working, and Artificial intelligence

# **Uses**

**Slack** - US based cloud service that facilitates internal team collaboration

**Google cloud platform** - Cloud service offered by Google that runs on the same infrastructure used for end-user products such as Google Search and YouTube

**Adobe creative cloud** - Set of applications and services from adobe systems, giving subscribers access to software for graphic design, video editing etc.

## Data and storage

Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage where the data is stored in logical pools, on “the cloud” Physical storage spans multiple servers in multiple locations and the physical environment is owned and managed by a hosting company

For example

- Google cloud
- Facebook
- Dropbox
- Gmail

## Runtime environment

- Provides a scalable computer & storage hosting environment, made of 3 components: Compute, Storage, and the Fabric controller
- The hosting environment is called the **Fabric Controller**  Having a pool of systems connected to a network, and managing resources by load-balancing
- Computer services provide an environment to run applications written in the various languages & technologies supported on the platform being used
- Storage services provide scalable storage for applications running on the cloud service in multiple forms

## **Middleware**

Software that works between an operating system and the applications running on it

Examples:

- Databases
- application servers
- web & transaction-processing monitors

All middleware performs communication functions. However the type a company chooses depends on what service is being used. Including security authentication, transaction management, message queues etc.

## **Operating systems**

A type of operating system designed to operate within cloud computing and virtualization environments.

## **Virtualisation**

Multiple applications, operating systems, and applications can run on the same machine & hardware at the same time, increasing the utilisation and flexibility of hardware

### **Benefits**

- More flexible and efficient allocation of resources
- Enhance development productivity
- It lowers the cost of IT infrastructure

- Remote access and rapid scalability
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Pay per use of the IT infrastructure on demand
- Enables running multiple operating system.

## Servers

A virtual server running in a cloud computing environment, it’s built, hosted and delivered by cloud computing platforms via the internet

A cloud server gives the business stability and security as any software problems are isolated from their environment

Often, cloud servers from reputable providers are stable fast and secure

Cloud servers are often better performance for the money, for example a cloud hosted website will run faster than an on premises hosted one, unless it’s set up by an expert

You can get scalability with cloud servers and it’s quick to upgrade and downgrade based on demand, for example, upgrading server capacity for a website during a sale

## Storage

Saving files to a remote server, with the ability to have access to them on  any device

- Google docs - Users can upload documents and spreadsheets to googles servers
- Web email providers such as Gmail all store emails on their servers
- YouTube holds millions of user uploaded videos
- Social media sites such as Instagram, and Facebook allow members to post various types of content, with the data being held on the respective companies server

Some services are free of charge but for any reasonable amount of storage usually they cost money, excluding social media

## Networking

Cloud networking is hosting, using some or all network resources and services, virtual routers, bandwidth, firewalls or network management software all from the cloud

In cloud **enabled** networking the network is on premises, but resources to manage it are in the cloud (an example of SaaS)

In cloud **based** networking the entire network is in the cloud (an example of IaaS)
