# Hardware components

# BIOS system

Non-volatile memory that contains instructions on how the computer should start up. Performs a POST (Power On Self Test) to check all voltages are correct for the components. 

The date & time (RTC - Real Time Clock) is held with a CMOS battery, as well as any changed settings in the BIOS.

CMOS - Complementary metal oxide semiconductor 

# UEFI

- User friendly graphical user interface
- Ability to use a mouse
- SecureBoot (I swear if you stop me installing Linux one more time)

### External bus

Also known as an external bus interface (EBI) or expansion bus

A type of data bus that enables external devices and components to connect with a computer

### Application specific integrated circuit

A microchip designed for special applications, for example handheld computers

### Field programable gate array (FPGA)

Integrated hardware circuit that can be programmed to carry out one or more logical operations. They are used for rear view cameras on vehicles, data analytics, encryption and AI

# Cooling

CPU’s (and sometimes GPU’s) get hot enough to need cooling

## Mineral oil cooling

Components are submerged in mineral oil, the heat that is generated is transferred to the mineral oil at a much faster rate than in air, in turn the mineral oil dissipates the heat

## Passive cooling

Cooling of components by slowing the speed at which the component is operating, usually throttling performance

## Active cooling

Using fans to reduce the heat of components (Most common method, and fairly cost effective)
