**The information**

- Project goal
- Tasks - Shown in the paper
- Resources - Staff profiles, skills, project costs
- Constraints (time) - Start date with an X day working week X hours a day with an X week deadline
- Risk analysis - 3 minor faults, 4 major
- Choices - Cloud or physical server

## Inferences

Just like being a detective, gathering clues and drawing conclusions, even when it’s not explicitly states

Used to make smart planning decisions to create a well reasoned plan

### The assumptions

- Staff can’t work on multiple things at once
- Current outgoing costs, is the employee pay included?
- Independent contractor employed to work based on expertise
- Staff are allocated tasks they’re proficient in (good at)

Ambiguity

Brooks law 

“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”

- Not all tasks can be easily divisible among team members
- Communication overload
- Training

It might seem like more people should mean faster completion, this shows that in complex projects or any that require communication or training it often extends how long it takes

**Evaluate arguments**

Sense-making

- Don’t include both a physical and a cloud server
- Software and hardware proficient staff, so choose the staff best suited to the task
- Unit testing is testing each module, integration testing is testing how each module works together, user acceptance testing is the final test to train staff
- Creating a test plan should happen before all testing

Analyse a problem solving

It should only happen once all of the relevant information is gathered

Identify dependancies

What need to be done before something else needs to be done 

duration normalisation

25 days = 200 hours, 8 hours a day

5 workdays a week, 5 work weeks = 25 days / 5 days a week

**Drawing conclusions**

All judgements are drawn and Gantt chart is made
