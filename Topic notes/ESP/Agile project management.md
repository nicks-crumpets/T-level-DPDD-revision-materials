# Agile manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Core beliefs

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Importance of people and their interactions rather than adherence to a strict protocol

Processes instead should support the activities of individuals

### Working solutions over comprehensive documentation

More important to have a working solution as opposed to a full instruction manual, aka, make the thing before you make a manual

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Building relationships and trust with clients is better than strict contract terms, leading to better understanding and more effective collaboration

Allows for adjustments to better meet the clients needs 

### Responding to change over following a plan

The ability to respond to change quickly even if it deviates from the original plan

Plans should be flexible

## 12 Agile principles

### Early & continuous delivery

Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Deliver in small increments allowing for feedback at each stage

### Embracing change

Welcoming changing requirements even late into development

It embraces change to get a competitive advantage

Fewer approval processes allow changes without delays

### Frequent delivery

deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to months

### Business and developer team collaboration

Collaboration ensures that any miscommunications are resolved as soon as possible, removing any delays

### Motivated individuals

Build projects around motivation, providing them with the environment and support that they need, leading to higher team morale and better quality work

### Face to face communication

The most efficient way of conveying information is a face-to-face information

Includes body language and tonality providing extra context to avoid misunderstandings

### Working software as a measure of progress

Having software is much better than having a full manual

### Sustainable development pace

Avoiding burnout or boredom by rushing or delaying a project

The team should maintain a constant pace for longer

### Continuous attention to technical excellence

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design, time should be set to improve processes and refactor code

### Simplicity

Maximizing the amount of work not done

Avoiding building features that don’t add real value to keep the project manageable 

### Self-Organising teams

When teams have autonomy they produce more effective and creative solutions, and are freer and more productive

### Reflect and improve

At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective and tune what they do accordingly, having a retrospective at the end of the sprint
