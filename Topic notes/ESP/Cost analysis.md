# Cost analysis

# Why is cost analysis so important?

- System integration is a major business undertaking
- Technology investments are expensive
- Business needs clarity & control
- Businesses need to answer: Will this system integration deliver real business value & a positive ROI*?
    - Cost analysis is key to answering this question

## Strategic decision making

- Informed system selection - Cost analysis provides objective data to compare different system options
- Align tech with business goals
- Avoid costly mistakes
- Maximise resource allocation

This benefits business with better more strategic technology, and choices that make business successful

## Financial responsibility & accountability

- Budget justification - Provide evidence to justify higher budgets to stakeholders/leadership
- Maximise ROI
- Financial transparency and control
- Minimise waste and overspending

This benefits business with stronger financial management, responsible spending, and maximised profitability 

## Risk mitigation

- Identify risks early
- Contingency planning
- Reduce financial surprises
- Improve project predictability

This benefits business by having a lower financial volatility, more predictable project outcomes, and greater overall business stability

## Long term value & sustainability

- Understand TCO** (total cost of ownership) - Complete picture of all costs over a system lifespan and not just initial costs
- Ensure long-term financial health - Evaluate systems impact on long term finances of the company
- Plan for future growth & scalability - Consider future costs associated with system upgrades, scaling and evolving business needs

# Step 1

Organise cost plan, structure spreadsheet with clear categories & years

- Y0
- Y1
- Y2 etc

Row

- Revenue
- Cost
- Cost item
- Total cost
- Profit

If options are present

- Option A analysis
- Option B analysis

# Step 2: All cost categories

Key costs to consider

- Initial costs (Y0) - Software & hardware perchace and installing
- Ongoing costs (Y1 &2)
- Personnel costs
- Infrastructure costs
- Operational costs

Think TCO** don’t just focus on the upfront price

# Step 3: Compare system options

- If choices, model them in spreadsheet
    - Cloud vs physical serve, explicitly compare them to each other
- Option cloud: Lower initial cost higher ongoing

# Step 4: Calculations

- Spreadsheet formulas are the best thing here - use SUM (or equivilent) formulas for percentages and other functions to automate calculations NEVER CALCULATE MANUALLY
- Year by year projections

# Step 5: Data driven justification

- Use cost analysis to justify system cost
- Compare total costs of options
- Highlight ROI* (if applicable)
- Explain any key cost drivers - Identify and explain major cost components and explain why they are necessary or justified

* Return on investment

** Total cost of ownership
