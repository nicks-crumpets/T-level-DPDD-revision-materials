# Scrum ceremonies

*Yup, it’s really weird* 

# Product backlog

Express value, defer decisions

- Owned by product owner
- High-level requirements
- Expressed as a business value
- Not complete or perfect
- Expected to change and evolve

Describes the tasks as user stories, and is prioritised by value and risk, including rough estimates and is publicly visible

## Impediment backlog

An issue that can’t be solved right away to be looked at, at the end of the sprint

## ‘Men’ hours

- Decide effective hours a day
- Calculate availability for each of the team
- Remove scrum planning and demo & review
- Remove holidays
- Subtract 10% for backlog refinement

# Tasks board

Stickers move on the board, and the board is public

to-do, in progress, done
