# SDLC

Its purpose is to break the making of software down into manageable steps

**The SDLC is a *framework* not a methodology, it’s often altered to fit certain ways of working**

# The steps

## Planning

What do you want to make?

Using **TELOS** to evaluate feasibility:

- **Technical** - Is the technology around?
- **Economical** - Is it within budget?
- **Legal** - Is there any copyright/legal issues?
- **Operational** - Will users be able to use it effectively?
- **Schedule** - Can it be completed on time?

The outcome is to have a project plan, with a software purpose, scope and resources

## Analysis

You need to check if you’ve got what you need to make what you want to make

(e.g. cheese and ham for a sandwich)

Also, you should check if you have the correct equipment

Use TELOS again to check feasibility

Should come out wi8th a requirement specification, documents etc

## Design

The UI/UX (How will the program behave/look etc)

What order will the prompts be etc

Create a blueprint of the program

## Development

Start making the program according to how you’ve designed it, how the software will be built

The outcome is a working program that’s ready for testing

## Testing

Test the program, testing that all the functions

Evaluate the program, how well it works, if there are any errors fix them

Does the program meet the users requirements?

## Implementation

Make sure the program is ready for release

## Maintenance

If the program needs updating make sure that its easy to update and a plan is set out for how its updated

CAP for maintenance:

- Corrective - Correcting after release
- Adaptive - Making changes to meet new requirements
- Perfective - Better the performance of the software

## Methodologies

Methodologies are important because…

Consider:

- Project goals - What needs to be achieved
- Team structure - How the team is organised
- Project complexity - Is the project simple or complicated
- Timeline - How much time is available
- Budget - What the financial retrains are

For example a small fast paced project would benefit from agile, whereas a large and complex project may benefit from waterfall

## Waterfall methodology

Requirements

Design

Implementation

Verification 

Maintenance

## Agile methodology

- Scrum - Short sprints of 2 - 4 weeks with regular reviews
- Kanban - Visual boards to track progress

Best for projects that require constant feedback

It has high quality deliverables, and rapid adjustments to changing requirements

## Scrum methodology

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Development team

Best for fast paced projects with evolving requirements (e.g. software development)

**Positives**

- Encourages teamwork and accountability
- Delivers results fast

**Negatives**

- Requires experienced team members

## Lean methodology

- Define value from the customers perspective
- Map the value stream and eliminate non value adding activities

Best for projects focussed on efficiency

**Positives**

- Reduces waste and improves efficiency
- Focusses on delivering value to the customer

**Negatives**

- Requires a culture shift towards continuous improvement

## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

Business modelling → Data modelling → Process modelling → Application generation → Generation

Best for projects needing quick delivery and frequent user feedback

## Prince 2

Business justification defined roles and stage based planning

Best for large and complex projects with a strict governance

**Positives**

- Clear structure and accountability
- Focused on continuous business justification

**Weaknesses**

- Can be overly bureaucratic for small projects

## Boehm spiral

Iterative development with a strong emphasis on risk management

Each spiral loop represents a phase, planning, risk analysis, engineering and evaluation

Best for large complex projects with a high level of uncertainty

**Positives**

- Focusses on risk assessment and allows for iterative refinement

**Negatives**

- Not great for deadlines

## Hybrid methodologies

Combining methodologies to meet a projects needs

Using agile for software development and waterfall for hardware integration

Best for projects mixed with requirements or multiple components

**Positives**

- Flexibility to adapt to different project phases
- Combines the strengths of multiple methodologies

**Weaknesses**

- Requires constant monitoring
