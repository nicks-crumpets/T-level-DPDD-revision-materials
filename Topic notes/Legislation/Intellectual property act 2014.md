## Ownership of commissioned designs

Before the act, if a business commissioned a design, they automatically owned it. The act shifted the balance (or lack thereof) so the designer retains ownership unless the contract says otherwise.

Impact:

- Freelance designers now hold more power in their contracts to clarify ownership
- Clients must be more precise in their contracts to clarify ownership
- This has led to increased negotiation between designers and clients fostering greater transparency

## Employee created designs

Designs created by employees as part of their job role are owned by the employer.
