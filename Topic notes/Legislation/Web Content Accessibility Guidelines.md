# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

WCAG

# Web accessibility

A way of making your websites useable by as many people as possible

This includes not just people with disabilities, but also making sites accessible for mobile devices, or for slow internet connections. 

The main points of accessibility are:

- Equal opportunities - Treating everyone equally, regardless of ability or circumstances
- Human rights - Everyone shares the same human rights, which should be respected by all

- Physical and digital access - Excluding someone from a website due to a visual impairment is the same as excluding someone from a building because they require a wheelchair
- Ethical and legal responsibilities - Accessibility is both a moral right but also in lots of countries, a legal right

*Also, it may make sense for the business to make it accessible for the sake of broadening their customer base, otherwise they may miss out on customers that have accessibility requirements.*

All of these points are designed to ensure that accessibility is maintained for everyone, no matter their differences.

- Global collaboration - WCAG is developed through the W3C process with global cooperation aiming to create a shared standard to benefit everyone
- Broad applicability - WCAG is designed to work with current and future web technologies. Tested through automated tools & human evaluation

# The 4 Principles

In the acronym P-O-U-R! **ðŸ«—

- **P**erceivable - Information and user interface in a way users can perceive using only one sense
    - Text alternatives - Provide text alternatives to non-text elements, so it can easily be changed into other forms (large print, braille, speech symbols or simpler language)
    - Time-based media - Provide alternatives for time based media
    - Adaptable - Create content that can be presented in different ways (e.g. simpler layout) without loosing information or structure
    - Distinguishable - Make it easier for users to see and hear content, including separating content from the background (foreground from background)

- **U**nderstandable - Digital content should be easy to understand & use in predictable ways
    - Readable - Make text content readable & understandable
    - Predictable - Make webpages appear & operate in predictable ways
    - Input assistance - Help users void & correct mistakes
    

- **O**perable - All users should be able to interact with the interface & navigate the website. Interactive elements should le large enough for people with mobility issues.
    - Keyboard accessible - Make all functionality available through a keyboard
    - Enough time - Provide users enough time to read & use content (No buy in 30 secs!)
    - Seizures - Do not design content in a way known to cause seizures
    - Navigable - Provide ways to help users navigate, find content & know where they are

- **R**obust - A websites content should be able to be interpreted by a wide range of user agents, including for example a screen reader
    - Parsing - Content must have no major code errors so it can be reliably interpreted
    - Name, Role, Value - All interactive elements must have programmatically determines names, roles & values
    - Status messages - Must be announced to assistive technologies without taking focus from the main content

Businesses can choose to use POUR as a core part of their development process in order to expend their customers to people with disabilities, helping the business make more money.

## Levels of conformance

### Level A - Minimum accessibility

The most basic web accessibility level, addresses the issues that prevent the majority of users from accessing content, a site meeting level A removes the most critical barriers for users with disabilities but may still contain significant accessibility issues

### Level AA - Mid-range accessibility

Includes all previous requirement criteria, and is a site considered accessible for most users including those with significant visual, auditory, cognitive or motor requirements.

Most laws, such as ADA, in the US, or the European Accessibility Act, require this compliance level

### Level AAA - Highest accessibility

Includes all previous criteria, and is accessible to the broadest range of users but is often impractical for all content to achieve this due to the strict criteria. 

This compliance is considered â€˜idealâ€™ but not required by any laws
