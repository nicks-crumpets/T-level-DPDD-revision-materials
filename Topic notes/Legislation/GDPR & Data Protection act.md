# GDPR & Data Protection act

*An EU law that came into effect May 25th 2018, establishing strict rules on how organisations must handle the personal data of EU residents*

The key principles are:

- Lawfulness, fairness & transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimisation
- Accuracy

- Storage limitation
- Integrity & confidentiality
- Accountability

# What was it before 2018?

- Data must be collected and used fairly and inside the law
- Data must only be held and used for the reasons given to the
    
    Information Commissioner
    
- Data can only be used for those registered purposes. You
cannot give it away or sell it unless you said you would initially. For
example, your school could not sell pupils' data to a book or uniform
supplier without permission
- The data held must be acceptable, appropriate and not
beyond what is necessary when compared with the purpose for which the
data is held
- Data must be accurate and be kept up to date. For example, making sure data subjects' contact numbers are current
- Data must not be kept longer than is necessary. This rule
means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers
longer than a few years at most
- Data must be kept safe and secure, for example, personal data should not be left open to be viewed by just anyone
- Data may not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area

(that's the EU plus some small European countries) unless the country 
where the data is being sent has a suitable and similar data protection 
law. This part of the Data Protection Act has led to some countries 
passing compatible laws to allow computer data centres to be located in 
their jurisdiction

## Personal data

- IP address
- Phone number
- ID Number
- Many more

Essentially anything that can be tracked back to you and used to find a person

# How Brexit changed it

EU GDPR no longer applied in the UK, as we left, and UK created ‘UK GDPR’ *original, I know*

It merged the previous GDPR rules and more specific to the UK

The UK became a ‘third country’ under EU GDPR

EU granted the UK ‘adequacy status’ allowing free data flow

Many organisations now have to comply with both laws

ICO remains the UK’s data protection authority, and no longer part of the EU data protection board

## The difference

UK applies to UK, EU applies to EU

UK gov determines adequacy for themselves

UK, ICO is the sole authority

EU, each country has their sole authority

UK, digital consent age is 13

EU, it’s 16, member states can lower this to 13

## Fines

UK = 8.7M or 2% of the firms total annual worldwide turnover from the preceding financial year, whichever is highest

## The data protection at 2018 principles

### Lawfulness

- Must meet one of the lawful bases defines in GDPR

### Fairness

- Data cannot be used in unjustified ways
- Cannot have adverse affects on a person(s)
- Reasonable expectations of individuals regarding use of personal data

### Transparency

- Be open and honest about data processing
- Provide privacy notices
