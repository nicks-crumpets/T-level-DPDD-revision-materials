# Globalisation

# What is globalisation?

*“The process by which businesses, cultures, and economies become interconnected through international trade, communication and technology”*

# Marshall McLuhan’s global village

***The person who predicted the internet***

The concept was introduced from his books “books “The Gutenberg Galaxy” (1962) and “Understanding Media” (1964)

McLuhan's Global Village concept envisioned a world interconnected by electronic media, where information would be shared instantly across vast distances. 

He predicted this would lead to a simultaneous, shared experience of events globally, shrinking the world into a village-like community. 

This interconnectedness, he argued, would profoundly change human interactions and cultural dynamics, though not always for the better.

What he believed:

- People would be able to communicate and share information instantly across the globe
- Everyone in the world could experience events in a “simultaneous global experience”
- He said it would be the ‘collapse of space and time’ that electronic media would eliminate distance as a factor of communication
- Global interconnectedness where the world would shrink to his ‘Global village’

What he *predicted*:

- Global communication networks
- Visual communication across vast distances
- Portable connectivity devices
- Devices being interconnected & sharing information
- Immersing in experiences regardless of physical location
- Global access to learning resources

## The technological role

The rapid advancement of technology has accelerated globalisation by enabling instant communication, digital transactions and global trade

For example: the internet, mobile technology and cloud computing

## The evolution of globalisation

Key aspects:

- Technological advancements in transportation & communication
- Trade liberalisation & economic policies
- Rise of global supply chains & multinational corporations

**Implications**:

- Increasing economic interdependence
- Rapid transmission of economic shocks globally
- Technology as a catalyst for trade growth and resilience

 **Milestones**:

- Slow growth during 19th century Industrial Revolution
- Sharp acceleration post-1950 (modern globalization era)
- Over 5000% growth from 1913 to 2014

### How technology drives globalisation

- **Faster communication** - Technologies such as email, social media and video calling enables real time global communication
- **E-Commerce and trade** - Platforms such as amazon and aliexpress allow companies and individuals to trade globally
- **Global workforce** - Freelance platforms and remote work allows hiring from anywhere in the world

### What has it caused

- **Skills gap** - Globalisation demands new skill sets, with an emphasis on technology. The 4th industrial revolution has caused this demand in digital literacy, programming and data analysis
- **Remote work** - Tech has enabled the rise of the ‘gig economy’ & remote work. COVID-19 caused an initial rush from 17% of US workers to 44%, and 11% to 38%

### What impact did the pandemic have on global connections?

- Digital transformations - Rapid worldwide adoption of remote work technologies
- E-Commerce boom - Huge growth in cross-border online shopping
- Scientific collaboration - Open sharing of research data across the world
- Remote education - Virtual exchange programs over physical ones
- Digital entertainment - Rise of international ‘viral’ events and global streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Discovery+)
- Travel and tourism - Temporary collapse of global tourism industry
- Supply chain disruption - Shortages of goods and materials
- Labour market impacts - Job losses in global industries
- Geopolitical tensions - Blame game of the origins & handling of the virus
- Cancellations of large cultural gatherings
