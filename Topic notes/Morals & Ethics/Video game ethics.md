# Gambling in games

## Loot Boxes

Virtual items that players pay for or earn (with earning being much harder) Players don’t know what they will receive and usually only a few items are good.

Many argue that loot boxes are gambling, as the encourage players to spend copious amounts of money 

### Star wars battlefront II

It gave paying players a severe advantage that paid. 

After much controversy the pay-to-win elements were removed

# Video game violence

Spoiler: Video games don’t cause violence unless someone has issues

## Concerns

Many games have been criticized for being violent and that this could according to them cause more violence in the real world. 

There is correlation between violent video games and violence but correlation doesn’t mean causation.

# Gender representation in video games

Historically, and still common in some games, there is a large gender gap. 

Male characters are most commonly the stronger characters, whereas the female counterparts are known for being typically weaker and often hyper sexualised. Often to the point where even the same armour looks a lot more revealing on a female character, despite giving the same benefits to gameplay

## Tomb raider

Laura croft was heavily sexualized throughout her early titles notably in the 1990’s. She notoriously had very exaggerated proportions, and rather limited character depth

However, more recent tomb raider games have her redesigned to be more realistic, and have a better character depth with focusses on things that are not her body

## LGBTQ representation in games

Typically it has been lacklustre

Historically, LGBTQ+ representation has been either completely absent or portrayed poorly and with negative stereotypes, whenever present, it was done badly.

### The last of us part II

Features a protagonist and player character ‘Ellie’ who is openly lesbian, and explores complex relationships

### Dragon age: Inquisition

Allows multiple LGBTQ+ players to engage in same sex romances

### Life is strange (Series)

The introduction of Max Caulfield and her relationship, allowing players to navigate meaingful storylines with LGBTQ+ themes and it would take center stage depending on player choices

# Morality in games

Games such as Life is Strange, Detroit become human and Beyond two souls all have a morality engine, essentially meaning they base large core elements of the game around morality and decision making

They encourage players to think about their actions and what consequences it could lead to, in order to add an element of challenge to the game. Also adding to the replay ability of the game, by players wanting to see what would have happened if they had chosen the other option.

# Trolling in games

*‘Intentionally disruptive or inflammatory behaviour in online gaming communities’*

This includes harassment, grief, and offensive language.

A 2020 report by the Anti-Defamation League found that 81% of players aged 13-17 had experienced harassment in online multiplayer games, with trolling and hate speech being the most common forms of abuse.

# Child gaming

There has been an ongoing debate from the debut of the first home computer game system, of how much screen time is too much or too little for children.

In bad cases this can lead to issues such as poor sleep, lowered academic ability, and a lack of physical activity.

### Exposure to mature content

Many games contain violence, sexual content, and inappropriate language, which raises issues around what is age appropriate for a young player.

There are systems that are used to rate what video games are acceptable for each age group, such as the ERSB in  the United States of America, and PEGI, for European countries, as well as some others. However these ratings are often ignored, and importantly can be too strict, for example if a game is okay for people aged 14+, in PEGI, it would be rated a PEGI 16, as there's only 3,7,12,16, and 18.

Furthermore there are plenty of online games available that have no official age rating and can be freely accessed with an internet connection.
