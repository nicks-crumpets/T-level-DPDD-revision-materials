# IoT - Internet of things

# IoT device

*“A device that isn’t typically connected to the internet, but can be”*

# IoT

“A network of physical objects that connects to a network”

This includes sensors, home appliances, wearables, etc.

*The internet of things connects everyday devices to the internet, creating smarter and more efficient systems, impacting many aspects of modern life*

## Evolution of IoT

***1989 - First IoT device was created***

1993 - First online webcam is used at Cambridge

***1999 - Kevin Ashton coins the term ‘Internet of Things’***

2000 - LG announces the first ‘smart’ (IoT) fridge

***2005 - UN publishes first report on IoT***

***2007 - First ‘smart’ phone (iPhone)***

***2008 - Fitbit activity tracker is launched***

***2011 - Industrial IoT is created***

2014 - Seoul becomes the worlds first ‘smart’ city

***2015 - IoT is present in most smartphones***

2016 - AWS IoT core is launched

2020 - The number of IoT devices becomes over 50% of worldwide devices

***2021 - 10 Billion active IoT devices worldwide***

As of 2024 there were over 15 Billion IoT devices worldwide, projected to reach 29.42 Billion by 2030

## How IoT works

1. Sensors - Motion detectors, cameras etc collect data from the environment
2. Connectivity - IoT devices connect via wireless technologies to send data to cloud platforms or other device(s)
3. Cloud & Data processing - Data collected is commonly processed in the cloud, or locally, with data analysis carried out to interpret and act on the data. 
4. UI (User Interface) - Apps, touchscreens, buttons and voice assistants allow users to control & interact with IoT devices/systems

## Impact & Importance of IoT

The global IoT market is worth ~ $1Bn USD (2025)

With billions of devices connected the data generated allows for improved decision making and efficiency across various sectors.

# Key applications of IoT

- Smart homes - Doorbells, fridges, ovens, washing machines etc
- Healthcare - Wearables, remote monitoring etc
- IIoT (Industrial IoT) - Used in factories for predictive maintenance to increase efficiency
- ‘Smart’ cities - Used to manage traffic, reduce energy usage, enhance pubic safety etc

# Benefits of IoT

- Reduced costs - Automating processes and using real time monitoring cuts down on labour and therefore employee count
- Improved safety - Monitoring workplace environments to identify hazards before accidents happen
- Reduction in human error - Tasks that needed manual input are automated leaving little to no chance for human error
- Data collection - Collects & shares data through embedded sensors, provides organisations vast amounts of information for analysis

# Negatives of IoT

- Security vulnerabilities - Often IoT has weak security protocols, making them susceptible to cyber hacks
- Data privacy - Masses of personal data are collected causing concern over how organisations use it
- Compatibility issues - Many devices and platforms cause issues working together
- Reliability - IoT devices require constant internet connection (typically, good ones can run on local networks) and power supply (or battery backup) to function, masses would fail with server or power issues
