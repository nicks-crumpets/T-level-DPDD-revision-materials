The lack of equal access to technology based on income, location etc.

The gap between those who have access to modern information and communication and those who don’t

- 5.9 Million adults in the UK have never used the internet
- 4.1 Million adults living in social housing that are offline
- Southeast has highest population of recent internet users (90%) NI had lowest (80%)

- 16-24 have biggest internet use
- 75 - 90% require a computer
- Offline households miss out on savings of £560/yr (exclusive online deals)

Age, income, education, disability, geographic location are all factors that contribute negatively and positively to the digital divide
