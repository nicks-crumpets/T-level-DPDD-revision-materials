# Big Data

*“Large, complex datasets, generated from various sources such as social media, IoT devices and sensors”*

# The 6 V’s of data:

- Volume - Amount of data from various sources
- Variety - Types; Structured, semi-structured and unstructured
- Velocity - Speed that big data is generated

- Veracity - Degree that big data can be trusted
- Value - business value of data collected
- Variability - How big data can be used & formatted

## Why is it so important?

It’s used for various things in everyday life, mainly:

- Decision making - Using big data to make informed decisions, have improved efficiency, and to predict trends
- Personalisation - To tailor marketing to an individuals preferences
- Innovation - It drives AI technologies, including machine learning and predictive analysis, leading to new technologies and better solutions

### Random data facts!

Every day approx. 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created by the expansion of the internet

90% of the worlds data was created in the last 2 years (hence finding old stuff can be very hard, internet archive FTW!)

On Facebook users upload 350 million photos a day, 1 - 1.75 petabytes of data daily

# Privacy concerns

- Data collection - Companies often collect much more data than needed, leading to privacy and surveillance concerns
- Surveillance - Governments & companies can track people using big data, raising concerns about control & consent
- Lack of control - Once collected, an individual often has little/no power on how their personal data is used

## Cambridge Analytica

In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, had improperly harvested data from 87 million Facebook users **without their consent**

- It is **“extremely likely to have impacted”** the **US election 2016** and the **UK referendum** (Brexit)
- Quiz app “This is your digital life” connected 270,000 peoples friends and allowed the collection of data from millions of Facebook profiles.
- Facebook was fined $5Billion due to its role in the data beach by the FTC (Federal trade commission)

# Data legality and morality

## Consent

- Control over personal data - Most online users don’t fully understand terms they agree to (What’s stored, collected and used etc)
- Implied consent - Most services use opt-in by default and require you to manually opt out
- Hidden agreements - Companies, commonly social media platforms, bury consent agreements in privacy policies, leading users to agree to share more data than they realise

## Ownership

- Company ownership - Often they assert ownership over all or the vast majority of the data collected through their platforms and services, creating a debate over users needing more rights over their own data
- User ownership movement(s) - There’s a growing advocacy for individuals to own their data, with some suggesting system(s) where companies should compensate users for the use of their data
- Data portability - Regulations such as GDPR gives people the right to request that their data be transferred to another service provider, increasing control over their own data

## Data bias & fairness

- Data reflects society - Big data reflects social biases and this is often shown in big data
- Discrimination - AI systems may discriminate over people of a different race, ethnicity et
- Ethical responsibility - Companies and governments should work to eliminate bias (But aren't incentivized to!)

# Can Big Data be fair?

## Ethical guidelines

- Transparency - Companies should be clear about data collection & how it is used
- Accountability - There must be consequences for misuse/unethical practices
- Consent - Users should have clear, accessible options to give & withdraw consent for data collection & use

## Predicted future of big data ethics

- Stronger regulation - Governments across the world are introducing stricter privacy laws (California CCPA, UK GDPR)
- Consumer rights - Consumers are demanding more control of their data, pushing companies to rethink data practices (or just deny and deny and bury them further)
- Balancing innovation and ethics - As data becomes the backbone of technological innovation, ethics need to adapt to keep use responsible

# The main issues

- Privacy
- Data ownership
- Bias
