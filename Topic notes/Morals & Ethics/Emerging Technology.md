# Emerging Technology

# What is emerging technology?

Any technology that is new, or growing at a very rapid rate. There is no strict definition of what ‘emerging tech’ is, as not all technology that is emerging at one time may ever become popular, and therefore its potential would not be fully seen

## Influence of science fiction on technology

- 2001 A space odyssey (1968)
    - Normalized the idea of ‘AI’ through HAL 900
    - Siri released in 2014 (god awful)
- Dick Tracy (1990)
    - Wrist communication watches, now the various smartwatches
- The lawnmower man (1992)
    - Virtual Reality, now HTC Vive and oculus rift
- Star trek: The next generation
    - Devices that can print objects, now 3D printers

- Blade runner (1982)
    - Neon cityscapes & digital billboards
- Back to the future part II (1989)
    - Fingerprint sensors for home entry & devices
    - Hoverboards, not to the extent of the movie but closeish
- The cable guy (1996)
    - Prediction of smart TV’s
- Die another day (2002)
    - Invisible car using camouflage
    

## DNA stored on crystals

Researchers have possibly discovered methods to store DNA in crystal structures, potentially a way to store human DNA for long periods of time. 

Mostly, this is a good insight into how humans could survive after earth. 

## Amputees

3D printing and other manufacturing techniques have managed to make prosthetics to make them cheaper

## 3D printing

Layered material fused together to make a 3D structure

- Prosthetics
- Figurines

## The future of 3D printing

3D printed food! Yea it’s goofy, and probably taste weird

Maybe we get to printing organs?

## Synthetic biology

Printing meat!

Redesigning organisms for useful purposes by engineering them to have new abilities

Upside foods

First company to have sold lab grown chicken. 

Cells are taken from a live animal, grown in a lab in a nutrient solution and structured into meat products using advanced bioreactors, mimicking natural growth. 

## Smart Glasses

It’s slowly becoming more possible and realistic to make smart glasses as opposed to the clunky google glass

- Healthcare (eh)
- Navigation
- Gaming/Entertainment
- Enterprise use

# Real world applications

- **Healthcare** - Surgeons can use AR glasses to overlay X-Rays/MRI’s onto a patient during surgery
- **Navigation** - Pedestrians & drivers can use AR glasses to view real-time directions
- **Gaming & Entertainment** - AR glasses create immersive gaming experiences by projecting virtual elements into real world spaces
- **Enterprise use** - Warehouse workers can use AR glasses to scan & sort inventory hands-free

# Quantum computing

Quantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways standard computers can’t match. Instead of binary bits, QC’s use qbits which can exist in multiple states at once, allowing for much better computational power.

- **Cryptography**: Quantum computers can break encryption algorithms currently unbreakable by classical computers, prompting a need for new, quantum-resistant security methods.
- **Drug Discovery**: Quantum computing can simulate molecular structures, enabling faster and more accurate development of new medicines.

# Cloud and edge computing

- Cloud Computing - Centralises computing resources on servers, providing scalable computing power on demand
- Edge Computing - Brings computation closer to the data source, reducing latency and improving real-time processing capabilities

## Applications

- Autonomous vehicles - Used to process data from sensors in real-time, enabling faster decision-making
- **Healthcare -** Allows hospitals to process data from IoT medical devices without latency, improving patient monitoring and response times
- **Retail -** Retailers use cloud computing to track inventory and manage supply chains with real-time data
- **Commercial space travel** - Companies such as Blue Origin# are starting space tourism and cargo transport to the ISS
- **Satellite internet** - Companies are launching constellations of low-Earth  orbit satellites to provide global internet coverage, even in remote locations

### Benefits

- **Climate Monitoring -** Satellites are used to monitor changes in Earth’s climate, offering crucial data to understand and combat global warming.
- **Global Communication -** Satellite networks enable communication in remote areas, supporting disaster recovery and emergency response.

# Brain-computer interfaces

A BCI allows direct communication between the brain and an external device

These can be used to control prosthetic limbs, computers, robots etc through thinking
