# The environment in technology

## Positive impacts of technology

- Renewable energy technology (solar, hydro, geothermic etc.)
- Environmental monitoring/data collection (Satellite monitoring)
- Waste management & recycling (Waste to energy, recycling)
- Remote working (less transport and heating offices)

## Negative impacts of technology

- Increased power consumption (4% Greenhouse gas emissions are IT, data centres use 70B kWh annually)
- Resources used (1 phone = 12,760L water and relies on rare earth metals, can cause environmental destruction)
- E-Waste (In 2022 57.4Mil. metric tones of e-waste were produced globally)

## E-waste

- Can release harmful harmful substances into the environment (toxic metals such as lead & mercury)
- WEE is how they are supposed to be recycled
- Only 17.4% of e-waste is recycled globally

## Planned obsolescence (Companies aren’t your friend)

A strategy where there is a planned limited lifespan

- Technological obsolescence
    - New models with improved features make old ones seem outdated
- Programmed obsolescence
    - Designed to stop working or become less functional after a set time

- Perceived obsolescence
    - Marketing creating a want for a new models
    - ‘Fashion’ trends
- Systemic
    - Updates to software or systems making older hardware incompatible
    - **Windows requiring TPM 2.0, and generally much higher minimum specs**

## Alternatives

The old stuff! Simply put, use old hardware for as long as possible, or change the operating system in a way that could help the device run longer

## Smart cities

Urban areas using technology & data to improve efficiency, and provide services

What do they have?

- Internet of things devices
- Big data analysis
- Artificial Intelligence
- Citizen engagement platforms

### Environmental benefits

- Smart grids with optimised energy distribution
- Intelligent street lighting
- IoT waste bins for optimised collection routes
- Automated recycling systems
- Real-time traffic management, helping to reduce traffic and congestion
- Easy and high use of electric and shared mobility options
- Smart water metering and leak detection systems
- IoT powered urban farming
- Smart Irrigation systems for parks

## Challenges & considerations

- Data centres and network requirements
- Manufacturing & disposal of IoT devices that are often cheaply made
- Balancing data collection with individuals privacy
- Providing equal access to a smart cities benefits
- Protecting critical urban infrastructure from cyber threats
