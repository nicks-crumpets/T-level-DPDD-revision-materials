# Autonomous Systems

## Positives

- Systems can run 24/7 without any intervention
- Costs a lot less as there is less people to pay (but harms job market)
- Increased precision and accuracy (mainly in repetitive tasks)
- Ability to work in harmful environments
- Consistently has the same outcome

## Negatives

- Large job displacement
- Safety concerns (Malfunctions etc.)
- Ethical dilemmas (Trolley problem)
- Privacy issues, data collection can raise concerns
- Bias and unfairness
- Public trust is low

# **Trolley problem**

A thought experiment in ethics & phycology, with the following idea:

If a trolley continues it **will** kill 5 people. 

If you switch it to another track it **will** kill a single person

![An image of the trolley problem, a trolley is heading directly towards 5 people tied to a track and cannot escape, 1 person is attached to another track that branches off of the main track. There is a person standing by a lever to change what track the trolley uses.](Autonomous%20Systems%20be29b89b25b34c4a91fa9d9f773e999f/163853c9-5b90-4b75-832b-e581645dcc4c.png)

## Real life trolley problem

June 2003, 31 unmanned train cars escaped a train yard heading for downtown LA, only 35 miles away

There was 4 different options:

- *Do nothing*, it to go to downtown Los Angeles
- *Send it* to hit an oncoming passenger train

- *Send it* into a neighbourhood nearby with a large (near definite) chance of derailment
- *Send it* into a hazardous waste train

The choice was made to send it into a neighbourhood, where 11 cars derailed as it switched tracks, destroying homes and displacing 150 residents, but with *no serious injuries or deaths* at all in the event.

In this case, doing nothing would have been a very bad decision, as it would have almost definitely caused some deaths and injuries, though it may not have been the perfect choice.

# The 5 *main* moral ‘pillars’

### Utilitarian

Focuses on the outcomes and the best possible outcome 

### Value of life

Is one life better than another, if so how?

### Deontological

Following the moral rules of not harming another person regardless of greater good

### Action vs Inaction

Is there a moral difference between doing something and not doing anything?

### Moral responsibility & blame

Who holds responsibility? The lever puller or who lead to this problem happening

## Self-Driving car Technology

- No automation
- Driver assistance
- Partial automation

- Conditional automation
- High automation
- *Full automation (Theoretical)*

## Drone technology in warfare

- Controversial use in targeted killings
- Concerns over civilian casualties

- Many debates over autonomous weapons systems
- Questions over international law

## Autonomous pizza

Food making robots like a pizza making robot for example, are often robotic arms that prepare food from start to finish. It requires no human intervention, and allows for time management via an algorithm

The pizza robot can make up to 80 pizza’s an hour continuously without breaks, saving the business money

They offer a variety of classic and gourmet pizzas with options to customise them.

The robot ‘Pazzi’ has computer vision for quality control, AI for process optimisation , and IoT sensors for inventory management

**Advantages:**

- Consistent quality
- No labour costs
- 24/7 Operating capability
- Fast service during peak hours

**Challenges:**

- High initial investment
- Limited menu flexibility
- Job displacement in food service
- Customer acceptance of robot made food
