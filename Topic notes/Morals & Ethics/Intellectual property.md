# Intellectual property

# What is IP?

It refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, software, literary works, designs and symbols. IP law gives creators exclusive rights to use their inventions or works

# Piracy

The illegal copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted materials often through torrenting

## Concerns over piracy

- Undermines creators abilities to profit from their work and potentially hurting industries
- Torrenting sites are for sharing large files, commonly used for piracy which has its ethical concerns
- Economic impact: Leads to loss of revenue for industries, mainly the film and computer game industry
- Inhibiting violation: by stealing digital products it can discourage innovation particular for smaller creators
- Legal repercussions: Torrent sites and piracy sites have faced lawsuits and some been taken away

## The Pirate Bay

- One of the largest torrenting websites
    - Sued and banned in many countries, taken down but just reappears
- Enables free access to copyrighted content

## Patents

- Tech companies rely on patents to protect their IP, some patents however are far too broad
- Patents are more commonly broken in areas where the game is too expensive due to import taxes or a poor currency
- Should tech companies be making things more affordable? Or are people responsible for getting legitimate copies?

## Microsoft & Software Piracy

- They face significant piracy against mainly their operating system (Windows) and their office programs mainly when the price is too high or in  countries where getting a legitimate copy is difficult

## Licensing and fair use

Open source vs proprietary software

- Open source software encourages collaboration
- Proprietary keeps it sealed to the team

## Creative commons

Provides a set of licenses to get creators credit while allowing some use

- Attribution - Must credit the creator
- Non commercial (NC) - Cannot be used to profit any money
- No Derivatives - The work can only be used exactly as it is, not in any other way
- Share alike (SA) - Any new material produced using the work must use the exact same licenses

## 3D Printing and Unlicensed designs

- Often these can be pirated if they are copyrighted
- Many are shared and have no licenses
- Many online platforms allow users to download and sell 3D models, some of which are copyrighted and distributed without permission
- Ethical dilemma - Selling or sharing the designs without licensing harms the original creators, raising questions over how ethical 3D printing is

## Parody law

Parody is the use of copyrighted material to create a humorous or satire versions of the original work

In many countries, parody is protected under fair use (U.S.) or fair dealing (UK), as long as the parody adds commentary, criticism, or humour that transforms the original work.

## Fan art

Fan art involves the creation of art based on existing copyrighted characters or settings

When sold or monetized, can violate copyright laws, most companies tolerate fan art non commercially, even though it infringes on copyright law it is rarely enforced

Companies such as Nintendo are very strict with their IP law, where as others are much more relaxed, such as Marvel or DC

## CGI, Licensing, and passed actors

- Is it wrong to recreate people who have passed in the name on continuing a series?
- Necromarketing, the use of people who have passed in current content

## Public domain

The public domain consists of creative works, inventions, or information that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, patents, or trademarks

Anyone can use, modify, or distribute these works without permission from or compensation to the original creator.

Works enter the public domain when their copyright protection expires, typically 70 years after the creatorâ€™s death (in most jurisdictions)

Or, creators can choose to place their works in the public domain by waiving their copyright rights (e.g, using a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license)

For example, the original mickey the mouse, and original whinnie the poh
