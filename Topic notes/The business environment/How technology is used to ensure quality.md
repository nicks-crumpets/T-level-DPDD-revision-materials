# How technology is used to ensure quality

# Effective functionality

- Do what we want it to - Defined through the scope
- Do the task we want it to do effectively - Goals are set
- Has an appropriate outcome - Testing takes place to ensure this
- Is what we expected - Testing & fixing bugs sorts this out

# Reducing issues/pain points

## Human error

Errors typically happening with routine tasks such as data entry, when a person makes a mistake when doing the task, such as a miss click

Typically occur when there's a bad rule to follow, good rules are applied incorrectly or a failure to follow a good rule

Bad rules are established most often by workers who have done things the same way over a long period of time

Also, when there is a lack of rules are knowledge for a task, and can be eliminated primarily through automation and training

### Siloed departments

Where departments have poor communications, and operate independently from each other, making data sharing extremely difficult or impossible

### Network protection

Protecting networks with better security, stronger passwords etc is the best way to secure networks

### Agility

Organisations need be fast, focused, and flexible

## Accessibility considerations

### Graphical user interfaces

GUI Interfaces need to be used to ensure that they are the most user friendly

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Intuative approach - GUI’s are simple to use even if you don’t have any training | System resources -  Graphical processing causes greater load to be placed on computer resources, mainly on the GPU |
| Multitasking - GUI systems offer a simple way of multitasking, allowing users to have many open applications & switch between them | Control - GUI systems provide the user with much less control than a command line interface, though the vast majority of users never need that level of control |
| Visuals - GUI systems provide a more pleasant visual experience, made up of objects to keep a consistent look & feel |  |

### Natural language interfaces

Allow the user to interact using spoken commands, rather than ‘computer language’

Examples of this are Siri, Alexa, Home assistant Voice, etc.

However they can be difficult to use, and variation in tone and accent often lead to misinterpretation

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Users do not have to learn the syntax of a language | A voice software needs training to understand what the user is saying |
| Much more suitable for anyone with a physical disability | Misinterpretation due to ambiguous or unclear input |
| Provides a safer way of interfacing with a computer in environments such as a car |  |

## Motion tracking interfaces

Very little, typically no training is required to interact with these systems

Developments in VR are using motion tracking interfaces into mainstream computing

Virtual reality applications are programs that show the user simulated 3D worlds they can move around, and interact with

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Enables users to explore realistic worlds | Hardware is very expensive and software is often the limiting factor due to the complexity of a virtual world |
| Users can interact with artificial environments in a safe and controlled setting, such as flight simulation | Movement is still restricted in virtual worlds as its limited to the size of the room you’re in |
| Can be a massive cost saver, training resources are limited and expensive, this allows for a wider variety of training resources whenever needed at a fraction of the cost | Training in a VR world using motion tracking doesn’t have the same accuracy as the real world  |

## Touch screen interfaces

A touch screen works as both an input and output device, the actual screen is the output device, and the digitiser is the input device, allowing you to interact with elements on the screen

The two types of touch screens are:

- Resistive -Much older technology based on force
- Capacitive - Newer technology, detects actual touch, and these are the screens you cant touch unless you use your finger or a stylus

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Ease of use - Intuitive and require little to no training | Not suitable for inputting large volumes of data  |
| Can be used without additional peripherals | Easily damaged, often due to being portable they’re fragile |
| Switches and buttons are not required as software designers can make and modify various interfaces for varying situations | Loss of accuracy due to needing to select options with fingers rather than a near pixel perfect mouse pointer |
| Capacitive multi-touch functions various inputs such as pinch-to-zoon is possible | Expensive, large touchscreens can cost many times more than a mouse and keyboard  |
| Hygiene - Much easier to wipe clean than a keyboard and mouse (though often not and left rather disgusting) |  |

## Other issues

- Colour deficiency/colour blindness
- Visual and hearing impairments
- Cross platform compatibility such as being available on various devices and platforms

The solution to this is:

- HTML5! A markup language used primarily for making websites, its development encourages greater interoperability between different devices

# Cultural awareness and diversity

Its extremely important that business are culturally aware and diverse, knowing things such as:

- Various learning styles
- Differing ways of life
- Calendar differences
- Disabilities

This is a massive consideration, for example when developing an operating system, a developer that’s tasked with making the calendar system needs to make sure that all calendar styles are available, as not every country uses the common western style calendar
