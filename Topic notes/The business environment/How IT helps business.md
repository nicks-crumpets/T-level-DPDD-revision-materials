# How IT helps business

# Stock control

Computerised stock control systems allow for stock valuation & find out how well an item is selling

A computerised system is an essential choice for businesses dealing with large differing items of stock

Stock & pricing data integrating with accounting and invoicing systems, within all systems drawing on the same data.

And there’s more…

- Automatic stock monitoring - Re orders when there is low stock
- Automatic batch control - Used for batch production goods
- Barcode systems - Speeds up processing and recording
- RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) - enables individual products to be tracked throughout the supply chain

## Hardware

- EPOS - Electronic Point Of Sale, a computerised checkout till that uses digital devices to both take payment and record sales. Making sales points faster and more efficient due to the very low error rate because human error is no longer a factor
- For example barcode readers get used to add new products to a sale
- Optical Mark Readers are used to input lottery tickets
- Magnetic ink character readers are used to verify cheques used for payment
- Chip and pin devices are used for taking card payments
- Near Field Communication is used for taking card payments

## Stock management

- Computers and servers are used by shops to manage their stock, typically with database management systems that run on servers, connecting to the EPOS systems.
- The sale → Database update process:
    - Product sold
    - Info sent to server
    - Database updated with the new lower stock level
- Stock management servers can also be connected via the internet to servers that are in the companies distribution centres so they know how many each store needs. New stock arrives before old stock runs out
- The systems automate large amounts of the stock monitoring and order making process that much less admin staff are needed, leading to saving the business money through both wages and a reduction in human error throughout both processes. (This links back to the morals and ethics of this)

## Retail websites

- The vast majority if not all (excluding local) shops have an online retail presence to sell and advertise products
- A web server is needed to host a website as well as a computer to develop and maintain the website. Updates would be adding/removing items or pricing changes
    - In comparison to a physical store this is many times cheaper
- Products can be sold worldwide as opposed to people who live nearby/travel to the store, and sales can be made 24/7

## Administration

Various different software's are used by businesses, for example:

- Spreadsheets - Tracking expenditures and calculating taxes
- Accounting software - Similar to spreadsheets but may be used on mass for employee pay and is more automated
- Word processors - Creating reports
- Desktop publishing - Creating advertising materials
- Presentation software - Giving presentations or training courses
- Messaging platforms - Internal communications (also external)

Businesses also use digital devices such as work phones to transfer information from severs, for example emails from a mail server (IMAP, SMTP)

All of these aspects make a business more productive as less time is spent correcting human error, and more automation is done, saving time

## Video Conferencing

- Various software's used for video meetings over the internet:
    - Zoom
    - Citrix GoToMeeting (not massive but still used in businesses a lot!)
    - Microsoft Teams
    - Slack (Max 50 people per call  or “huddle”)

They allow you to have a video call like with VoIP. But are designed for many people to take part in the meeting.

Some have added features such as displaying presentations and sharing documents with participants

Saves businesses time and money from making employees travel to different locations to take part in a meeting, and supports employees working from home

## Design and manufacturing

A sector that makes heavy use of digital devices and technologies

- CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software is used by people to produce technical drawings and 3D models to produce/design products/parts or for architectural drawings
- CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) controlled machinery (such as a 3D printer) are used to produce things designed with CAD software

Makes business more efficient as CAD designs can be easily modified, designs can be easily sent by cloud file sharing or directly over the network (or email, but I doubt the file size would be small enough for enough services)

Machinery doesn't need breaks too and can theoretically run 24/7 (However if it can get hot, or it is machinery with a large blade it may need monitoring to make sure any catastrophic error damage is limited)

Human error is reduced as CAM controlled machinery does exactly what it is programmed to

## 3D Graphics

Video game and Film industries make heavy use of 3D graphics

- Known as CG-Effects (or GCI) are used rather than physical effects, for example making it look like there are explosions going on around an actor when there isn’t
- Most AA and AAA videogames use 3D graphics to render characters and environments to add realism. Virtual reality games are using this to place a real person inside of a 3D graphical environment

## Photo & Video Editing

Photos taken using digital cameras (and film if scanned) can be transferred to computers for editing

- Professional photographers use photo editing to fix lighting, remove objects and to remove blemishes from a persons face, or red-eye
-
