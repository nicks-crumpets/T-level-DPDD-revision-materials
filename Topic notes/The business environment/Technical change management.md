# Technical change management

—

## Configuration of the new system process

- Outline the steps
- Provide diagram/flowchart
- Explain how the change will help

# Methods of implementing change

## Parallel

- New and old system used alongside each other until all issues are resolved
- Involves duplication of work & can be expensive, but provides safety net
- Suitability depends on the workforce, and space/ability/economic feasibility to run on 2 systems at once

## Phased

- Using the new system on a stage basis
- Once one stage works correctly, that stage can be used
- Reduces effect of system failure, as only some functions are affected

## Direct changeover

- New system is exclusively used
- Easily managed method that doesn’t involve major work or cost
- If not tested can result in major issues
- This could result in essential actions being missed (bills etc)

## Pilot

- Running the new system in only on location
