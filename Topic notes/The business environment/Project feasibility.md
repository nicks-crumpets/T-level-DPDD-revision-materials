# Project feasibility

Feasibility is how easy or difficult it is to do something. When a goal is set, the long term feasibility has to be considered (is it a reasonable goal?)

# What’s the benefit?

# Economic

Looking at the **full** impact of the project from a purely money based standpoint, such as determining the cost of a given implementation

## Cost & benefit analysis

Provides good assessment of the economic viability of a project and are part of the feasibility analysis/study 

## Technical

It’s important for the project manager to determine the technology viability of the project, and its possible outcomes.

Often the people brainstorming a new ideas won’t know or have the technical knowledge to gauge if the solution is possible given the current technology available or capabilities of the company

## Operational

When looking as project that’s been scoped, its important to ask if the proposed solution actually solve the problem or fill the niche in the way it’s needed to.

By reviewing the considerations they can make a more informed decision if the existing product is what everyone wants or if it needs to be redesigned or re scoped 

## Schedule

What impact will implementing the current project have on any other projects? Will schedules slip or have to be pushed back?

Will the resources needed be available for the full implementation of the project? E.g. a temporary grant of £100,000 a month may need to last for all the project time to allow for continued development

## Legal & Political

When a project is being considered, and features scoped its important to determine if there are any legal issues with the implementation

Can be due to government regulation, patent infringement issues, company compliance (unless you own it) etc.

Understanding this is important to ensure that the project development isn’t suddenly shuttered due to a legal issue, such as Yuzu having to shut down after legal threats from Nintendo

## Economic

Identifies any financial benefits and costs associated with a project 

# SWOT

**S** trengths - What are your and your employees strengths? What resources and skills do you have? What services or products does your business have that are unique?

**W** eaknesses - Where is your business lacking? What skillsets do you need to improve? Are the weaknesses you have a hinderance to your success?

**O** pportunities - What environmental opportunities are available? Economy, labour force, social trends, location, Events etc 

**T** hreats - What are the environmental **threats** to your business? Economy, location etc.

## Internal vs External & Positives vs Negatives

Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors, whereas opportunities and threats are external factors

Strengths and opportunities are positive factors, whereas weaknesses and threats are negative factors

# Dependencies

Dependencies between tasks need to be understood before a project schedule can be created. And they help work out the order of tasks

In most project management software there are 4 ways to link tasks together to build a schedule:

1. Finish to start (FS) → Most common dependency, task A must finish before task B can start
2. Start to Start (SS) → Both tasks **must** start at the same time
3. Finish to finish (FF) → Both tasks **must** finish at the same time
4. Start to finish (SF) → Task B cannot finish until task A has started

# Constraints

*Simply, the things that limit what you can do*

Constraints are related to dependencies, they both affect how work is scheduled and resources are planned out. Having to complete a project in 6 weeks → The time **constraint** is 6 weeks

Having to develop software within brand guidelines are a **constraint** on the creativity of the team

Having to fix software with only certain tools are **constraints** on what you’re allowed to use

# Risks

Simply, anything that can go wrong

Which is a **lot** of things

It ranges anywhere from funding being cut, all the way to having mass layoffs due to ‘restructuring’ at the company that’s doing the project

Ultimately all risks, if they come true, will have a negative impact on the company, and the project(s) that are being worked on
