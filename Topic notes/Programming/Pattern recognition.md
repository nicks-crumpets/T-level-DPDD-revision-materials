# Pattern recognition

Recognising patterns in order to solve problems, or solve them more efficiently

*This is done after decomposition*

## Whatâ€™s a pattern?

Patterns are things that are common between problems or programs

## The enigma code

One of the most famous examples of pattern recognition was the solving of the enigma code by Alan Turing (Used to listen to German messages in WW2)

## Facial recognition

Software identifies and confirms someone's identity using photos, videos or in real time, using the patterns with someone's face

# Why bother?

By identifying and recognising patterns, it is possible in code to locate pre existing module(s) of code

## The 5 steps to pattern recognition

1. Identifying and interpreting common elements in problems or systems - If there is a common pattern, chances are there is an existing solution
2. Identifying and interpreting common differences in problems or systems
3. Identifying individual elements in the patterns - The elements can be input, output or process
4. Describing patterns that have been identified
5. Making predictions based on identified patterns - Either using it multiple times in code or in a different program
