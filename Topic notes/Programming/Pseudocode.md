# Pseudocode

*An informal programming description showing flow through a process*

*This is used in **design documentation** which is documentation  about a program or digital system (anything that explains how a program works)*

---

It’s written in a format similar to a high level programming language, and provides an outline of what the program should do and achieve

It has its own syntax and won’t run unless translated into a specific high level programming language

# Why bother?

It makes it really simple to communicate code to various developers that know completely different languages

It’s very simple to follow even with minor errors as it’s more descriptive than lots of high level programming languages

Clearly explains each line of code so it can be referred back to if there is confusion on what a line of code should be doing

## Who uses it?

Mainly, development teams that know various different languages.

It’s not used to communicate with clients, as to a client it can still look fairly complicated, and contains large amounts of information that are redundant to them and just used for development and maintenance
