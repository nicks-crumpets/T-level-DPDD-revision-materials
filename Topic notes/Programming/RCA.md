# RCA

Root Cause Analysis

RCA takes the approach of looking at the problem and find why and how it happened, as opposed to who did what

# The purpose

To find the ‘root’ of an issue by asking questions, such as:

- What is the problem?
- What caused the problem?
- How can the problem be solved?

Once the root has been found, the situation is assessed and it is noted how a similar issue could be mitigated in future

## Why use RCA?

Because there’s no point in solving a constantly reoccurring problem without figuring out what’s causing it, as it wastes time, money, and other resources

## The outcomes

Problems can either be simple, with a single root cause

Or more complex, with multiple root causes

Time should be given to establishing if all of the root causes to a problem have been found

## Documentation

There has to be sufficient documentation to support the identification of any corrective actions, and to ensure that future problems don’t reoccur, as there is now documentation on how the root cause was found, and how it was solved

# How do you do it?

The most popular method is:

## The 5 whys

Where for every answer to a ‘why’ question a further more deep why question is asked, until the root cause is found
