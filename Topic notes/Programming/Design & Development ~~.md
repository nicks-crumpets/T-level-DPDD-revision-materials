# Design & Development ~~

# Key Factors 🔑

Factors to consider when developing:

- Abstraction of data
- Use of predefined code

- Readability of code
- Quality of code

## Abstraction

Just the simplification of data, car is a simplification of a complex machine

## Data type example 📄

a 16 bit number can be used 4x in a place where only 1x 32 bit number would fit

High level abstraction is a general outline

## Predefined code 🧑‍💻

Saves people from writing large amounts of code for common tasks 

## Readability of code 👀

*A good program is made so that it is as easy as possible for a human to understand*

- Clear comments
- Meaningful variable names
- Agreed naming convention
- Not having to scroll sideways to see code
