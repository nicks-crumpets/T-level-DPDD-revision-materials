# Importance of data to organisations

# What data can you get from a receipt?

- Geography - Town, city etc
- Products & combos purchaced
- Quantity purchased
- Loyalty

- Minimum spend
- Retailer
- Purchase data & times
- Brands purchased

## How’s it useful?

- Spending by time of day - See how much people like to spend at what times of the day
- Competition - See what the most competitive products are, what’s popular etc.
- Spending by store - What stores are most popular? Then the company can improve poor stores

# Defining data

*Raw facts & figures collected during business operations*

For example:

- Number of website visitors
- Product inventory levels
- Customer demographics

Types of data

- Qualitative data - Descriptive information (Feedback, opinions etc)
- Quantitative data - Numerical information (sales numbers, statistics)cess

# Data → Information

Processed data is data that's meaningful and useful for decision-making

### Data processing steps

- Collection - Gathering data from various sources
- Validation - Ensuring data accuracy and reliability
- Analysis - Identifying patterns & trends
- Interpretation - Giving context, helping insights

### Why is it important?

- Informed decisions - To enable strategic planning
- Competitive advantage - Organisations that leverage information will outperform those who don’t

# Data collection methods

## Surveys & questionnaires

### Advantages

- Cost-effective - Inexpensive to administer, especially online
- Scalability - Easily reaches a large and diverse audience
- Standardisation - Ensuring consistent and reliable data collection

### Disadvantages

- Response bias - Answers may and often do reflect social desirability
- Low response rates - Often suffer from low engagement affecting data representativeness
- Lack of depth - Limited amount of detailed information

## Sensors & IoT devices

For example:

- Environmental sensors
- Wearables
- Industrial equipment

### Advantages

- Real time data - Continuous & immediate data
- Automation - Low human intervention
- High precision

### Disadvantages

- Data overload
- Privacy concerns
- Maintenance requirements

## Document analysis

For example:

- Reports
- Emails
- Social media posts

### Advantages

- Rich contextual data
- Non-intrusive
- High precision

### Disadvantages

- Time consuming - Takes extensive time to review
- Potential bias - May reflect the authors perspective
- Limited scope - may not provide comprehensive data

## Web scraping

For example:

- Price monitoring
- Market analysis

### Advantages

- Access to large data
- Cost effective
- customisable

### Disadvantages

- Legal & ethical issues
- Data quality (Don’t try and scrape news from the onion)
- Website structure changes breaking scrapers

## Social media mining

For example:

- Political sentiment analysis
- Event impact tracking
- Tourism trend analysis

### Advantages

- Real time analysis
- Broad reach
- Behavioural data

### Disadvantages

- Data privacy concerns
- Data ‘noise’ (rubbish data)
- Platform dependency

## Log data analysis

For example:

- Software usage tracking
- Network security monitoring
- Financial market analysis

### Advantages

- High accuracy
- Automated collection
- Actionable insights

### Disadvantages

- Large data volumes
- Complex, requiring specialised tools
- Privacy issues, logs often contain sensitive information

# Organisational uses of data

- Analyse market trends and patterns, for decision making
- Monitor users, to understand behaviours
- Targeted marketing, personalising to peoples individual needs
- System performance analysis, to ensure optimal function of the systems

## Analysing system performance

To ensure efficiency and user satisfaction

- Causes of reduced performance:
    - Increased storage use - Slowing down system operation
    - **Software Conflict**s- Causes incompatibility issues
    - **Software Updates -** May introduce new bugs
    - **Outdated Components -** Hardware can't support new software
    - **User Increase -** More users strain resources
- **Hardware Metrics**:
    - **CPU Utilisation -** Percentage of CPU capacity used
    - **Memory Usage -** Amount of RAM in use
    - **Storage Access Times -** Speed of data retrieval
- **Software Metrics**:
    - **Response Times -** Speed of system reactions to inputs
    - **Completion Rates -** Successful processing of tasks
    - **Bottleneck Identification -** Points where performance is limited
