# Using data

# Meaning of data

The true value of data is not in the data itself but in its use. The most common way to find the worth of data is by using the DIKW pyramid [small img?]

# Data, information & knowledge

Knowledge comes from accumulated information, understanding and recognising patterns is a type of knowledge.

Often this is based on experience, sometimes it is formalised into axioms, theories, concepts and definitions, meaning that knowledge requires learning

# Data analysis

**Data analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and  with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision

# Data-Driven decision making

Each level in the DIKW Pyramid is a step towards wisdom, the ability to make a judgement/decision

This enables businesses and individuals to do data-driven decision making, defined as using data (info, and knowledge) to guide strategic decisions that align with current objectives/goals/initiatives

Skipping over any level in the DKIW will likely lead to ill-informed decisions (correlation is not causation)

# Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

Organisations can using many tools to support data driven decision making. 

Tracking against key metrics can show how the organisation is performing, known as a KPI

A KPI is a quantifiable measure to help organisations continually track their performance

Some KPI’s are common across a company or whole industry (such as ones related to revenue, costs of sold goods and customer sales) Though most KPI’s will depend on the industry & business model of the organisation

## SMART

**SMART** goals framework suggests that goals or targets should be:

# Data Democratisation

This makes data accessible to employees at every level of an organisation, to improve everyone decision making

Historically, only a small set of data specialists owned data, meaning this is a large culture shift for some organisations, changing from data scarcity to an open-data culture

To help this, some companies may rely on dashboards *the term originated from car dashboards*

A company dashboard allows viewers to see many metrics in one area

# Data literacy

The ability to read, work with, analyse and argue with data

**Reading data** means being able to access and look at data in a spreadsheet or other format, while understanding what it represents

**Working with data** includes creating, cleaning, transforming, organising and managing data

**Analysing data** means using any or all of the 4 levels of data analysis to extract information from data

**Arguing with data** is what happens when data and information is converted into knowledge (The DKIW pyramid is how to argue with data)
