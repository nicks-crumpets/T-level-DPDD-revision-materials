## Strategic decision making

The long term decisions that give a direction for the entire company. Only senior management make these decisions due to the complexity and large potential impact

They will affect everything else in the organization, and usually set out how things are run to meet a long term goal

## Tactical decision making

These support the big *strategic goal* but with a focus on the medium term. They make plans & set up processes and guides to help the longer term decisions

These decisions are made by middle managers

This connects the big company goals to what’s happening with the company at a ground level

## Operational decision making

Day-to-day decisions that keep things running smoothly, they’re small and often repetitive things that must happen for the organization to run as normal. 

Often this is carried out by junior managers or supervisors

These must happen so they mitigate any small issues growing and that the bigger goals can succeed 

# Identifying Threats & Opportunities

To make a strategic decision, organisations identify the risks/threats & positives/opportunities

- Threats - Anything that could go wrong, such as a production run failure or a new competitor
- Opportunities - Things that could go well, such as overachieving the sales targets

*Be prepared for both the risks and the benefit of  a decision, no matter how much of a trend it may be, or personal thoughts*
