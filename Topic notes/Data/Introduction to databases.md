# Introduction to databases

Databases are built to organise mass amounts of data, and handle relationships between them

They also can remove duplication and prevent data loss

*A  database is a container that holds tables and other SQL structures related to the tables*

A table is the structure inside a database that contains data, organised into columns and rows

The columns are the categories of data, a row is a record

DataBase Management System

A program used to manage a database 

Relational DataBase Management System

Specific type of DBMS that organisese data into structured tables with rows and columns

Structured Query Language

Langauge used to communicate with databases (RDBMS)

# Normalisation

Process of organising data to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency

- Eliminates data redundancy
- Ensures data consistency
- Simplify data maintenance

1NF - Each tables has unique rows

2NF

3NF

# Primary key

A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table

# Foreign key

A column in one table that links to a primary key in another table

keys connect related data across tables, and enforce referential integrity (prevent an order from being linked to a customer that doesnâ€™t exist)
