# Data analysis & foundations

# What’s data?

Data is the plural of ‘datum’, a single fact that’s recorded, measured, or collected by a form of observation by a human or machine

Data is a **collection** of recorded facts, being the much more common word, as single items of data are very uncommon

## Recording data

Data is recorded or gathered from observations and/or measurements

To be data, it **must be recorded** in some way, *a verbal comment or memory is not data*.

# Tabular data

Most common way of organising data is in tables (tabular)

[Add images of row, column and cell]

Tabular data is a type of structured data

the information that each column represents is known as a field or variable

# Unstructured data

Data that is unstructured and doesn’t have a particular structure or format.

Location data, email, messages, imagery, sensor readings etc.  

more than 80% of new data produced is unstructured

# Semi Structured data

Has elements of both structured and unstructured data

Doesn’t have the structure of tabular or spreadsheet data.

It has some structure in the form of tags and metadata that help people group, describe and analyse the data.

JSON and XML are the most common ones used

This also links to **Qual**itative and **Quan**titative data

# Nominal & ordinal data

**Ordinal data**

Qualitative data that is ordered and ranked. The data has a natural hierarchy where the distance between the categories is not known

**Nominal data**

A type of qualitative data categorised into distinct groups, without any numerical value, or order. It is not ranked, or structured hierarchically, so is unsuitable for maths

# Discrete data

Any data that’s counted using *whole* numbers, not any decimals or fractions

For example, number of people in a class is discrete, as you can’t have 0.5 of a person

# Continuous data

Numerical data that can have any value between two whole numbers, it **can** have decimals and fractions

For example, height is continuous, as a person can be 1.45 meters tall
