# The basics

The difference between data, information & knowledge

## Characteristics of data:

- Unprocessed - Has not been analysed or organised

# Examples of data

POIU^*1P OIBV

Completely random sequence of characters, with no inherent meaning, without surrounding information

# Types of data

## Qualitative

- Descriptive information
- For example, colours, textures & emotions (…or star ratings)

## Quantitative

- Numerical information
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc

## Types of qualitative data

- **Discrete** - countable whole units (shoe size)
- **Continuous** - Measurable, anything within a range (temp.)

## Types of quantitative data

- Nominal - Categories with no order (Colours)
- Ordinal - Categories *with* order (Grades, Clothing sizes)

# Role of structure

Structure is the format or arrangement of data that provides a consistent way to interpret data

For example, DD/MM/YYYY for dates

*But…*

European format → DD/MM/YYYY

US format → MM/DD/YYYY

*This is so convenient and never causes **any** issues , so…*

Universal ISO → YYYY/MM/DD

This is the universal standard for dates, so that people actually know when stuff is happening between countries

**And that's not it!!**

You can use a forward slash, dot, a dash, even a space, just to sprinkle in some more confusion

### More formats!

[Take from presentation]

# Transforming data into information

1. Start with raw data
2. Apply structure
3. Add context
4. Result

# Defining knowledge

“The understating and awareness gained from information through learning & experience”
