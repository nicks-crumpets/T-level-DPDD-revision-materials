# Data mining

# Where is it used?

## Patterns

- Descriptive
- Classification and prediction
- 

### Descriptive - Class/Concept

A class or concept is a group or category used to organise data 

### Frequent patterns

Repeated/common patterns in datasets

- Frequent item sets
    - Groups of items commonly bought/appearing together
    - Many customers buy break and milk together in a supermarket
- Frequent substances
    - When there’s a predictable order in which items or events occur
    - For example, a customer buying a camera is often followed by them buying a memory card

### Mining of association

A way to find interesting relationships between different sets

Involves analysing large datasets to see if there any connections between different variables or groups of items

### Classification

Sorting objects into different groups based on what we already know.

Such as “Pens” and “Pencils”

Used in data analysis to create a system or model that can look at new objects &decide what they belong to

### Prediction

Analysing data to make estimated guesses of future data…

# Applications of data mining

- Volume
    - Poses challenges in managing and analysing such large datasets
- Variety
    - The variety of data offers different perspectives that can be used to gain different insights
- Velocity
    - Trends must be kept up with to understand
- Veracity
    - Subject to errors and bias’s
- Value
    - Analysing data from different perspectives can be used to make decisions and improve outcomes
- Variability
    - Various sources, contributors etc
    - Can create inconsistencies & discrepancies  in the data that have to be addressed
